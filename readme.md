# lx

lx is a URL-shortening application created in CakePHP. The Git
repository is a top-skimming of the `/app` directory from CakePHP
v1.2.4. Also included in `/sql` is a database template for PostgreSQL.
*It is important to note, this code does not work and will need
significant revision before being functional.*  However, here is a
partial list of partially implemented features:

- URL addition
- URL deletion 
- URL redirection
- URL favoriting (through the "stars" concept)
- User accounts
- User verification
- URL renaming (title, not target)
- Some jQuery-based AJAX

Please use this as the basis for your own work.  If you wish to
contribute changes back, please do.
